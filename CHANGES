Version 4.14
------------

    Will now use the same version number as the Exim it's supposed to 
    correspond with.
    
    Added support for new local_scan features such as:
    
        debug_print method - accesses Exim's debug_printf() function

        Constants:
         
             LOG_PANIC
             LOCAL_SCAN_ACCEPT_FREEZE
             LOCAL_SCAN_ACCEPT_QUEUE
             LOCAL_SCAN_REJECT_NOLOGHDR
             LOCAL_SCAN_TEMPREJECT_NOLOGHDR
             MESSAGE_ID_LENGTH
             SPOOL_DATA_START_OFFSET
                     
        Variables:
        
             debug_selector
             host_checking
             message_id

    Calls to expand_string() that fail now return Exim's
    expand_string_message in the exception that's raised. 

    The patch_exim_makefile.py script actually works the way
    the README and README.FreeBSD files describe.
