Version 4.20.1
------------

    Several settings that were previously fixed at compile-time
    may now be set at run-time though the Exim 'configure' file.

    Notably: expy_path_add allows you to add a directory to the 
    Python path, so you don't have to have your local_scan module
    in the site-packages directory necessarily.  


Version 4.20
------------

    Change the way header_lines are represented in exim.headers  
    Instead of being two-element tuples (text, type), they're now 
    a custom object with .text, and .type attributes.   

    The .type attribute is settable, so you can set it to '*' to mark 
    header lines that exim should consider as being deleted.  The .text
    attribute is read-only

    Access to the text and type attributes through sequence_methods is 
    still possible for backwards compatibility (h[0] instead of h.text), 
    but deprecated.  This'll probably be yanked in future versions, so
    update your scripts!

    
Version 4.14
------------

    Will now use the same version number as the Exim it's supposed to 
    correspond with.
    
    Added support for new local_scan features such as:
    
        debug_print method - accesses Exim's debug_printf() function

        Constants:
         
             LOG_PANIC
             LOCAL_SCAN_ACCEPT_FREEZE
             LOCAL_SCAN_ACCEPT_QUEUE
             LOCAL_SCAN_REJECT_NOLOGHDR
             LOCAL_SCAN_TEMPREJECT_NOLOGHDR
             MESSAGE_ID_LENGTH
             SPOOL_DATA_START_OFFSET
                     
        Variables:
        
             debug_selector
             host_checking
             message_id

    Calls to expand_string() that fail now return Exim's
    expand_string_message in the exception that's raised. 

    The patch_exim_makefile.py script actually works the way
    the README and README.FreeBSD files describe.             
             
             
Version 1.0
